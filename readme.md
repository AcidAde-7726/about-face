# About Face -- FoundryVTT Module
About Face is a module for FoundryVTT that changes a token's direction based on movement.


## Installation
Simply use the install module screen within the FoundryVTT setup


## Usage
Just move your tokens!


## Known Issues / Limitations
This has only been tested with square grids (not hexes) and uses 45 degree snapping for tokens.

## Troubleshooting

#### How do I keep certain tokens from spinning?
- You can lock tokens by either double-clicking and selecting the token icon from the hud or accessing from the character sheet. The option you're looking for is "Lock Rotation" under the "Position" tab.
